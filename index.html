<p class="description">Na Hye-seok(Korean: 나혜석, April 28, 1896 – December 10, 1948) was a Korean feminist, poet, writer, painter, educator, and journalist. Her art name was Jeongwol (정월; 晶月). She was a pioneering Korean feminist writer and painter. She was the first female professional painter and the first feminist writer in Korea. She created some of the earliest Western-style paintings in Korea, and published feminist novels and short stories. She became well known as a feminist because of her criticism of the marital institution in the early 20th century.</p>

<p class="description">
  After graduating from Jinmyeong Girls' High School in 1913, she traveled to Japan and enrolled in the Tokyo Women's Art School, where she studied Western painting. During her time in Japan, she was also active in the Korean independence movement, participating in student-led nationalist activities. Upon returning to Korea in 1918, she pursued a career as both an artist and a writer, using her work to challenge traditional gender roles and advocate for women's emancipation.</p>

<p class="description">Her artistic and literary pursuits were deeply intertwined with her social activism, as she sought to express her progressive ideas through both mediums. She was particularly outspoken about issues that were considered highly controversial at the time, such as women's sexual rights and the institution of marriage. By openly discussing topics like love, divorce, and personal freedom, she defied the rigid expectations imposed on women in Korean society. However, these bold expressions came at a great personal cost, as she faced severe societal backlash that ultimately led to significant hardships in her later years.</p>

<p class="description">Despite these challenges, she remained unwavering in her commitment to her artistic and intellectual endeavors. Even as public opinion turned against her, she continued to produce work that reflected her beliefs and experiences. Though she was largely unrecognized during her lifetime, her legacy as a pioneering artist and feminist has since been reevaluated, and she is now regarded as a significant figure in Korea's modern history, celebrated for both her artistic achievements and her contributions to the advancement of women's rights.
